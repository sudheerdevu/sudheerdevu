## 🔬 Engineering Scope

I work across the AI compute stack — from Linux systems and low-level driver fundamentals to GPU execution providers and model inference optimization.

My work includes:

• AI model benchmarking & performance validation  
• ROCm ecosystem profiling & GPU analysis  
• ONNX Runtime execution provider integration (DirectML / MIGraphX)  
• Linux environment setup & debugging  
• Kernel-space fundamentals & device driver experimentation  
• Data-driven performance analytics  

This is not “benchmark execution.”  
This is systems-level AI workload engineering.

## 📈 Engineering Philosophy

Performance without profiling is speculation.  
Drivers without system awareness are fragile.  
AI without measurement is marketing.

I focus on measurable engineering truth across the compute stack.
